== Licence

Chellow is released under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[GPL v3].


== Introduction

Chellow is a web application for checking UK electricity bills. It's designed
for organizations with high electricity consumption. The software is hosted at
https://github.com/WessexWater/chellow.

== Installation

Chellow is a Python web application (with a built-in webserver) that uses the
PostgreSQL database. To install Chellow, follow these steps:

. Install http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] 9.5
. Install Python 3.5 (tested on the http://www.python.org/[CPython 3.5.1]
  interpreter)
. Create a PostgreSQL database called `chellow` with the character encoding
  `UTF8`.
. At the command line run:
+
 pip install chellow
+
. Set up the following environment variables to configure Chellow: +
+
|===
| Name | Default | Description 

| `PGUSER`
| `postgres`
| Postgres user name

| `PGPASSWORD`
| `postgres`
| Postgres password

| `PGHOST`
| `localhost`
| Postgres host name

| `PGPORT`
| `5432`
| Postgres port

| `PGDATABASE`
| `chellow`
| Postgres database name

| `CHELLOW_PORT`
| `80`
| Port that the Chellow webserver will listen on
|===
in bash an environment variable can be set by doing:

 export CHELLOW_PORT=8080
+
in Windows an environment variable can be set by doing:

 set CHELLOW_PORT=8080
+
. Start Chellow by running `chellow start`.
. You should now be able to visit `http://localhost/` in a browser. You should
  be prompted to enter a username and password. Enter the admin user name
  '`admin@example.com`' and the password '`admin`', and then the
  home page should appear. Change the admin password from the '`users`' page.
. Chellow can be stopped by running `chellow stop`.


=== Manual Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version of Chellow enter the following at the command
line:

 chellow_updater.sh


=== Automatic Upgrading

On Unix, set up a cron job to regularly call the updater script by doing:

 crontab -e

and entering the line:

 \* * * * * source /home/me/venv/bin/activate;chellow_updater.sh


=== Using A Different Webserver

Chellow comes bundled with the
http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/[Waitress] webserver,
but the is also a Python WSGI web application so Chellow can be used with any
WSGI compliant application server, eg Gunicorn. The WSGI app that should be
specified is `chellow.app`.

=== Detailed Instructions For Installing On CentOS 6.7 64 bit For Development

Install PostgreSQL 9.5.2

Add the PostgreSQL repository:

 sudo rpm -ivh https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.5/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-centos95-9.5-2.noarch.rpm

Install the PostgreSQL packages:

 sudo yum install postgresql95 postgresql95-server postgresql95-contrib

Initialize the database:

 sudo service postgresql-9.5 initdb

Make PostgreSQL start on boot:

 sudo chkconfig postgresql-9.5 on

Edit PostgreSQL config file to accept all local connections:

 sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/pg_hba.conf

Find the lines:

 local   all    all                    peer
 host    all    all    127.0.0.1/32    peer

and change them to:

 local   all    all                    trust
 host    all    all    127.0.0.1/32    trust

start PostgreSQL:

 sudo service postgresql-9.5 start

Install Python 3.5.1. Unfortunately there isn't an rpm for this so we have to compile it:

 sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"
 sudo yum install zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel wget
 wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tar.xz
 tar xf Python-3.5.1.tar.xz
 cd Python-3.5.1
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared LDFLAGS="Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib"
 make
 sudo make altinstall

We need to tell Chellow which port to listen on, so:

 vi ~/.bashrc

and add the line:

 export CHELLOW_PORT=8080
 export PGUSER=postgres
Clone the Chellow source from GitHub:

 git clone https://github.com/WessexWater/chellow.git

Change directory to the 'chellow' directory:

 cd chellow

Create a local 'test' branch to track the remote 'origin/test' branch:

 git branch --track test origin/test

Check out the 'test' branch into the working directory:

 git checkout test

Create a Python virtual environment:

 pyvenv-3.5 venv

Activate the environment:

 source venv/bin/activate

Make sure you're running a recent version of pip:

 pip install --upgrade pip

Install tox:

 pip install tox


Run tests:

 tox
 

==  Getting Started

This is a brief guide to setting things up after you've installed Chellow.


=== View the Chellow home page

Assuming you've installed Chellow correctly, you should be able to open your
browser, type in the URL of the Chellow application, and see the Chellow home
page.


=== Users

Before any users are added, if you access Chellow from `localhost` you'll have
read / write access. Once users are added, you have to log in as one of those
users. Users are added from the 'users' page.

Default users can be automatically assigned to requests from certain IP
addresses. To associate an IP address to a user, go to the non-core contract
`configuration` and add a line to the 'properties' field similar to the
following:

  {
    'ips': {'127.0.0.1': 'implicit-user@localhost'}
  }

Note that multiple IP addresses can be mapped to the same user.

=== Add Sites

Sites can be added by hand from the the 'sites' link on the home page. If
you've got a lot to enter, then you can import them using a CSV file.

=== Add Supplier Contracts

Click on 'supplier contracts' link and then fill out the 'Add a contract'
form. For the Charge Script field enter:

    
    
    def virtual_bill(data_source):
        data_source.supplier_bill['net-gbp'] = 0

This is the simplest possible virtual bill. To help with debugging you can
print things out to the CSV file:

    
    
    def virtual_bill(data_source):
        data_source.pw.println('The start date is ' +
	     str(data.source.start_date))
        data_source.supplier_bill['net-gbp'] = 0

To use half-hourly data to generate a bill based on a day / night tariff, you
can write:

    
    
    from net.sf.chellow.billing import NonCoreContract
    
    def virtual_bill(data_source):
        bill = data_source.supplier_bill 
    
        for hh in data_source.hh_data:
            if 0 < hh['utc-decimal-hour'] < 8:
                bill['night-kwh'] += hh['msp-kwh']
                bill['night-gbp'] += hh['msp-kwh'] * 0.05
            else:
                bill['day-kwh'] += hh['msp-kwh']
                bill['day-gbp'] += hh['msp-kwh'] * 0.1
    
        bill['net-gbp'] = sum(v for k, v in bill.items() if k[-4:] == '-gbp')

For documentation on the languages that Chellow uses, see the Extending
Chellow section.

#### Add HHDC Contracts

In the Properties text area you can set up a process that will check an FTP
server every hour and download any new HH data files. Here's an example:

    
    
    has.importer=yes
    file.type=.bg.csv
    hostname=data.example.com
    username=auser
    password=apassword
    directory0=.
    mpan.map=searchtext>replacetext

===  Add Supplies

Supplies are imported in a similar way to sites above.

  * Source - Where the supply gets its electricity from. 

net

    The DNO's network.
gen

     Generator that's embedded within the site, so that the electricity generated displaces the electricity that would otherwise have to be imported from the DNO's network. 

lm

    Load management generator
chp

    Combined heat and power.
turb

    Water turbine.
gen-net

    Generator that's directly connected to the DNO's network, so everything generated is exported to the network, and all parasitic electricity (imported by the generator) is imported from the network. Cf the source 'gen'. The generator types are the same as those available for the source 'gen'.
sub

    general sub-meter used for energy management.
3rd-party

    Where the electricity is from (or to) a party that is not the DNO.
3rd-party-reverse

    As 3rd-party, but where the meter's import is measuring the export to the 3rd party.

#### Import HH data

HH data can be imported in a variety of formats. Chellow can also be set up to
import files automatically from an FTP server.

#### Virtual Bills

To see the virtual bills for a supplier contract, go to the contract page and
follow the Virtual Bills link.

====  Example Site

To set up an example site, insert a HHDC called 'IMSERV HH' with provider UKDC
starting at 2010-06-01 and insert a supplier contract called 'SSE HH' with
provider SOUT starting at 2010-05-01. Then save the General Import Format text
below as a file with the extension '.csv' and then import it using the General
Imports form. It'll insert a site with a CHP supply and a supply from the
network. It'll also put in some HH data for the beginning of October 2010.

  * Lines beginning with the '#' character are comment lines.
  * You can import any number of lines, and mix actions and types in a single
    file.
  * When updating a record, if the field contains {no change}, then that field
    won't be updated.
  * A blank date field means 'ongoing'.

== HH Data Formats

Below are all the HH data formats accepted by Chellow. Chellow recognizes them
by their filename extension. The files may be compressed as zip files.


=== Stark DF2

File extension `.df2`.

The data file is of the form:

....    
#F2
#O 99 9999 9999 999
#S 2
27/07/05,00:30,95.4,A
27/07/05,01:00,93.8,A
27/07/05,01:30,91.9,A
....
    	
Values Of The Sensor Number `S`

|===
| Number | Meaning

| 1      | Import kWh
| 2      | Export kWh
| 3      | Import kVArh
| 4      | Export kVArh
|===

and the status character on the end is optional. For the newer six-channel
meters the channels are mapped to the DF2 format as follows:

[cols="3*"]
|===
|
| Import Related
| Export Related

| Active kWh
| #O mpan_core +
  #S 1
| #O mpan_core +
  #S 2

== Importing Bills

To import bills for a particular contract, create a batch, and then upload the
bill file. The following electricity bill formats can be imported. Chellow
recognizes the format by the file extension.

== Common Tasks

=== Merging Two Supplies

Say there are two supplies A and B, and you want to end up with just A. The
steps are:

  1. Back up the data by taking a snapshot of the database.
  2. Check that A and B have the same header data (LLFC, MTC etc).
  3. See if there are any overlapping channels, eg. do both A and B have import kVArh? If there are, then decide which one is going to be kept.
  4. Load the hh data for the required channels from the backup file. First take a copy of the file, then edit out the data you don't want, then further edit the file so that it loads into the new supply.
  5. Delete supply B.

== Reports

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| metered-import-*
| Uses HH data for HH and AMR supplies, and register reads for dumb NHH
  supplies.

| metered-import-estimated-kwh
| For HH data, the kWh with the 'E' flag.

| billed-import-*
| A daily rate is calculated for a bill, and applied to the number of days it
  covers of the month in question.
|===


=== Supplies Monthly Duration

Here's how Chellow calculates the monthly consumption for dumb NHH supplies.
First it finds the closest normal reads. Let's assume there are just two for
simplicity. For each TPR, Chellow works out the (historical kWh / hh) = (kWh
between the two reads) / (number of HHs between the two reads). Then Chellow
finds the number of HHs between the beginning of the month and the end of the
month, and also the number of HHs that fall within the TPR, between the
beginning and and of the month. The kWh for each half hour in the month for
each TPR is (historical kWh / hh) * (month half-hours) / (month half-hours
within TPR).

=== Bills

A row for each bill that falls within the given period.

=== Local Reports

Core reports come with Chellow and have odd ids. User reports are created by
users and have even numbers. Reports are written in Python, and often use
a Jinja2 template. You can display a link to a report of user reports by adding
the following line to the configuration:
    
    local.reports=82

replacing 82 with the id of the report of reports that you've created.


== Design Decisions

Why don't you use the +/- infinity values for timestamps? The problem is that it's not clear how this would translate into Python. So we currently use null for infinity, which naturally translates into None in Python.
