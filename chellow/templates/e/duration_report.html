	<p>
		Here's how Chellow calculates the monthly consumption for dumb NHH supplies. First
	 	it finds the closest normal reads. Let's assume there are just two for simplicity.
	 	For each TPR, Chellow works out the (historical kWh / hh) = (kWh between the two
	 	reads) / (number of HHs between the two reads). Then Chellow finds the number of
	 	HHs between the beginning of the month and the end of the month, and also the
	 	number of HHs that fall within the TPR, between the beginning and and of the month.
	 	The kWh for each half hour in the month for each TPR is (historical kWh / hh) *
		(month half-hours) / (month half-hours within TPR).
